                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2022-2026 Carnegie Mellon University
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Software developers who wish to develop free software may join the
FSF's Software Freedom Conservancy program. For more information,
see <https://www.sfconservancy.org/>.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed incorrectly to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, while remaining committed to protecting the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
free software on general-purpose computers, but we do not wish to
prevent patenting modes of providing functionality for a particular
program.  We wish to avoid the special danger that redistributors of
a free program will be individually able to obtain a license in order
to impose the most restrictive version possible on recipients.
  Unfortunately, the United States and other governments do not currently
restrict software patents in this way; any patent would be enforceable
in those jurisdictions.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion other than copying, making changes to the work to produce
a new work.  A "based work" means either the Program itself or any work
that contains the Program or a portion of the Program.

  A "standard interface" for an interoperability point means an
interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized
standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular
programming language, one that is widely used among developers working
in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the Program as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means either a) a "major component"
of an operating system upon which the executable runs, or b) a compiler
used to produce the work, or c) a tool for generating and executing
intermediate files used with the work.

  An "object code" means any non-source form of a work.

  A "source code" means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  Object code includes all output of compilations,
but not the source code itself.  Object code for a library in particular
includes header files and interface definition files, and the source
code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms.

  "You" is not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or a work based on the Program),
you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its
terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program
or works based on it.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 2 and 3 of this License
without any of the permissions set forth in section 4, only if you
receive the covered work from us under a separate license agreement
complying with the terms of this License that authorizes you to use,
copy, modify, distribute and exhibit the work.  This separate
agreement must be in writing and must state that you intend to release
the covered work under a different license agreement.  A separate
license agreement does not have to comply with all of the requirements
of this License.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Program, or a work based on an object code
produced by compiling the Program, and you convey a copy of the work
(including the object code) to any person, then the terms of this
License for that work are determined by the license you received for
that work.  Therefore, if you received that work under a separate
license agreement that authorizes you to use it for purposes other than
those stated in that agreement, then your rights are governed by that
agreement and not by this License.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of a work incorporating material from a header
file in a library (other than a "System Library") need not include
any of the material from that library's header file other than the
interface definitions needed for compiling the work.  However, you
must provide the source code for any object code produced by compiling
that work.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a combined work that is based on or derived from the
Program and that includes material from a library (including header
files) under your choice of license terms, provided that all such
material is either:

    a) released under a license that isGPL-compatible, and at least
       one of the following conditions applies to all such material:

      - (i) The copyright holder or author authorized to use the work;
            or
      - (ii) The material is accompanied by the corresponding written
            warranty, if any, that the material is free software; or

    b) contained in a separate license agreement with terms governing
       use and distribution of the combined work other than this License.

  For a combined work to be covered under sections 2 and 3, all such
material must meet both conditions (i) and (ii) above.  The
requirement for combined works is stricter than that for
modifications; it includes the material from the library's header file,
but only when included in object code form of a work based on the
library.

  5. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of
this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions applicable to the entire Program shall be
treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
that work.  Additional permissions may be written as a separate clause,
but you may not combine them with the Program unless you receive
written permission from the copyright holder.

  6. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify the Program except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License (including any other grants of permission).

  Upon termination, all license rights are reinstated automatically,
except as expressly provided in this License.  This does not apply
if the violation was caused by your activities during propagation.

  7. Limitation of Liability.

  In no event shall the copyright holder or authors be liable for any
damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential
damage arising out of the use or inability to use the Program (including
but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or
losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the Program
to operate with any other programs), even if such holder or author has
been advised of the possibility of such damages.

  8. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.  IN NO EVENT SHALL
THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAM OR THE USE OR OTHER
DEALINGS WITH THE PROGRAM.

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

  While redistributing the Program or a work based on it, you may
choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
this License.  You may incur costs for conveying copies of the Program,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  10. Public License for Large Files.

  For files that are too large to be included in a single copy of this
License, you must include the following notice at the beginning of each
source file:

    Copyright (C) 2022-2026 Carnegie Mellon University

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  Except as contained in this notice, the name of the copyright holder
shall not be used in advertising or otherwise to promote the sale, use
or other dealings in this Software without prior written authorization
from the copyright holder.
